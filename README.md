Mission
To build, repair, and restore lives for many generations.
Isaiah 58:12

Serving people

Equipping and building people

Vision
Building a city church in a community while empowering and reaching out to many generations.

Assignment
To lead God’s people into an effortless rest by understanding and believing in the finished work of Christ.
By faith in Jesus Christ, we walk in the reality that the debt was fully paid, the sentence fully served, and the victory fully won.
